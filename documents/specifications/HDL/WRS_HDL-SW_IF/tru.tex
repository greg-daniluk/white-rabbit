\subsection{Topology Resolution Unit (TRU)}
\label{sec:tru}

\noindent {\bf Description:}

Module provides hardware support for topology resolution protocols implemented
in software (e.g. RSTP, LACP). It is still under testing and development so it
shouldn't be supported by the next official release of the WR Switch software.\\
