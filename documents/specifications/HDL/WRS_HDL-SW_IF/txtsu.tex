\subsection{Tx Timestamping Unit (Tx TSU)}

\noindent {\bf Description:}

The module collects Tx timestamps for Ethernet frames sent through all 18
Endpoints available in WR Switch. Those timestamps are stored inside the FIFO
queue and can be fetched by the software running on the main CPU together with
the Frame ID (FID) and Port ID (PID). This additional information is used by
the CPU to associate the timestamp with appropriate frame that was sent through
\emph{NIC} and one (or multiple) of the Endpoints.

The module can also generate an interrupt (fed to VIC described in section
\ref{sec:vic}). It indicates that TxTSU stores at least one timestamp in its
FIFO.\\
