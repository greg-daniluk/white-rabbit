\subsection{Time-Aware Traffic Shaper Unit (TATSU)}

\noindent {\bf Description:}

The module implements simple Time-Aware Traffic Shaper. It creates a time window
at a given (configured) moment (TAI + cycles) in a data stream transmitted
through WR Switch. In this window only selected output queues are allowed (the
others are blocked).

The module is still under testing and development so it
shouldn't be supported by the next official release of WR Switch Software.\\
