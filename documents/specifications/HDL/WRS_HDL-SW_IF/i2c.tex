\subsection{$I^2C$ master}

There are three identical $I^2C$ masters:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{I2C0}: drives $I^2C$ GPIO expansion chip for ports 16-17
    \footnote{Check the schematics of WR Switch miniBackplane for details what
    is driven by those GPIOs.}
  \item \emph{I2C1}: drives $I^2C$ GPIO expansion chip for ports 0-15
  \item \emph{Sensors I2C}: connected to the set of \emph{TMP100} digital
    thermometers
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf Description:}

$I^2C$ master as its name says, implements the master of $I^2C$ bus. Before any
byte transfer is performed it must have the prescale value, used to
generate SCL clock, set.

The module is capable of generating interrupt, but it is not used in the WR Switch
design.\\
