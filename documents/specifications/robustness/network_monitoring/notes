NETWORK MONITORING (Diagnostic)
*******************************

Monitoring Requirements
***********************
- Guarantee the availability of the function 
	- Maintenance
	- Automatic reaction on operation anomalies:
		- Real-time confi. modification in case of error
		- Activation of redundant components
- Dynamic reactions to changes on the network and environments

	- Dynamic reaction to changes on the network
	- Dynamic adaption 
- Network Control

	- Collection of information
	- Definition of a database of network configurations

Traffic Analysis Applications requirements

	- Identify growth and abnormal occurrences in the network
	
Common Measurement Metrics
***********************
 Performance measurement
	- Availability: percentage of time that a network system, component or application is available for a user. It is based on the reliability of the individual component of a network.

Availability = MTBF / (MTBF +MTTR) 

MTBF .- mean time between failures
MTTR .- mean time to repair following a failure

	- Response time: the time it takes a system to react to a given input.
	- Accuracy: 
	- Throughput: quantity of data that can be sent over a link in a specified amount of time.
	- Utilization: a more fine-grained measure than throughput. It refers to determining the percentage of time that a resource is in use over a given period of time.
	- Latency and Jitter:  amount of time it takes a packet from source to destination. 

• Jitter: variance of intra-packet delay on a monodirectional link. 


Per-Link Measurements
*********************
• Metrics available on a link
	— # packets, # bytes, # packets discarded on a specific interface over the last minute
	— # flows, # of packets per flow
• It does not provide global network statistics.
• Useful to ISPs for traffic measurements.
• Examples:
	— SNMP MIBs
	— RTFM (Real-Time Flow Measurement)
	— Cisco NetFlow

End-to-End Measurements
***********************
• Network performance != Application performance
• Most of network measurements are end-to-end.
• Per path statistics
• How does the network behave with long/short probe packets?

Monitoring 
**********
Active Measurement
	— To inject network traffic and study how the network reacts to the traffic (e.g. ping).
	- Active measurements are often end-to-end
Passive Measurement
	— To monitor network traffic for the purpose of measurement (e.g. use the TCP three way handshake to measure network round-trip time).
	- passive measurements are limited to the link where the traffic is captured

• There is no good and bad. Both approaches are good, depending on the case:
	— Passive monitoring on a switched network can be an issue.
	— Injecting traffic on a satellite link is often doable only by the satellite provider.
• Usually the best is to combine both approaches and compare results.

Remote Monitoring with SNMP + Cisco NetFlow or RMON-1 or sFLOW (Layer 1 and Layer 2)

NetFlow / RMON / sFlow -> "flow-based" monitoring
SNMP -> "deviced-based" monitoring

SNMP Vs RMON
************
• The SNMP protocol is used to control and configure a probe. Usually GUI managers mask the complexity of SNMP-based configuration.
• Statistics and saved traffic are retrieved using SNMP by management applications to record statistics on a network and, possibly selected portions of the network traffic.

SNMP and RMON differ in the way they gather traffic statistics: 
— SNMP is a periodic poll-request process: it requires a query of the SNMP device to get network statistics (the network status is kept by the manager).
— RMON, on the other hand, reduces the stress of the manager by gathering and storing the statistics in counters or buckets for retrieval by a management station.





TRAFFIC MONITORING
******************

RMON
****

Collect data and periodically report it to a more central management station, which potentially reduces traffic on WAN links and polling overhead on the management station.
• Report on what hosts are attached to the LAN, how much they talk, and to whom 
• "see" all LAN traffic, full LAN utilization, and not just the traffic to or through the router.
• Filter and capture packets (so you don't have to visit a remote LAN and attach a LAN Analyzer) : it is basically a remote sniffer that can capture real-time traffic (until the integrated memory buffer is full).
• Automatically collect data, compare to thresholds, and send traps to your management station -- which offloads much of the work that might bog down the management station.



The RMON1 MIB consists of ten groups:

   1. Statistics: real-time LAN statistics e.g. utilization, collisions, CRC errors
   2. History: history of selected statistics
   3. Alarm: definitions for RMON SNMP traps to be sent when statistics exceed defined thresholds
   4. Hosts: host specific LAN statistics e.g. bytes sent/received, frames sent/received
   5. Hosts top N: record of N most active connections over a given time period
   6. Matrix: the sent-received traffic matrix between systems
   7. Filter: defines packet data patterns of interest e.g. MAC address or TCP port
   8. Capture: collect and forward packets matching the Filter
   9. Event: send alerts (SNMP traps) for the Alarm group
  10. Token Ring: extensions specific to Token Ring

• RMON usefull to compute network utilization.
• Network Utilization can be calculated for all the ports of a given switch at regular intervals. This information can be gathered over the course of a day and be used to generate a network utilization profile of a switch or hub.


NetFlow
*******
From Cisco, which menas: we cannot used it, though part of the protocol has been standardized.

SFlow
*****
(From wiki copy and paste)

sFlow uses sampling to achieve scalability[7] and is, for this reason, applicable to high speed networks (gigabit per second speeds and higher).[8] sFlow is supported by multiple network device manufacturers[9] and network management software vendors.[10]

An sFlow system consists of multiple devices performing two types of sampling: random sampling of packets[1] or application layer operations,[3] and time-based sampling of counters.[1] The sampled packet/operation and counter information, referred to as flow samples and counter samples respectively, are sent as sFlow datagrams to a central server running software that analyzes and reports on network traffic; the sFlow collector.[11]

Flow samples

Based on a defined sampling rate, an average of 1 out of N packets/operations is randomly sampled. This type of sampling does not provide a 100% accurate result, but it does provide a result with quantifiable accuracy.[12]

Counter samples

A polling interval defines how often the network device sends interface counters. sFlow counter sampling is more efficient than SNMP polling when monitoring a large number of interfaces.[13]


PERFORMANCE AND FEATURES
************************
Read the documentation

Conclusion
**********
Apparently SFlow suits perfect for us, it can bee implemented in hardware, low bandwidth usage, memory usage, scalability and server load.
That would be in the switches... Now if we speak about the server, MAster Management Node... well take a look at the last doc... they are using a server... we should think if the Master Management is going to take care of the protocols and then storage everything in a server...it looks like to me.
