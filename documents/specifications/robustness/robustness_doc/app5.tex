\chapter{Appendix: Potential Modifications to RTU required by RSTP}
\label{appE}

Potential changes to RTU needed by RSTP: \\
1. RTU@HW:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Blocking of incoming packages per-VLAN (currently only per-port).
  \item Blocking of outcoming packages per-port (currently only per-VLAN).
\end{itemize}
2. RTU@SW:
\begin{itemize}
  \item aging of information on a given port - this means queuing Filtering
Database for the entries belonging to given port, and removing (aging out) this
entries).
  \item changes enabling control of new HW parameters.
\end{itemize}
