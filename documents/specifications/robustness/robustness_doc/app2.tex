\section{Control Messages Size at CERN}
The appendix presents how the Control Message size for CERN was estimated.
Since there is no official document on this yet, the below information is not
official but can be useful.

Each event consists of
\begin{itemize}
  \item Address, estimated size: 32 bits
  \item Timestamps, estimated size: 64 bits
  \item Event Header (IDs), size: 32 bits
  \item Event Payload, size: 64 bits
\end{itemize}

The total size of single event is estimated to be 192 bits or 24 bytes.
In the current control system at CERN, there are 7 events generated per each of
7 distribution networks (per machine). This gives 49 events every Granularity
Window. 

As a consequence, for the current system, the Control Message size would equal
1176 bytes. However, the current number of events is not sufficient. Therefore,
it is suggested to increase it. A desired number of events is not defined, the
more the better. Four-fold increase, to 200 events, would be very appreciated.
This gives the Control Message size of 4800 bytes. 

Therefore, the minimum Control Message size given in the document equals 1200
bytes and the maximum size is rounded to 5000 bytes.
