1.  Introduction (ML):
    - explanatin of WR
    - introduce different kinds of info:Timing Info, Control Data, Standard Data
    - we need to point out that increase of robustness in WR is optional, it
will work with no redundancy the same good (as long as all components work)-
intention - not to scare potential clients
1.1 WR Network Requirements (regarding Robustness and Determinism)
    - Control Messages :
       * one message lost in one year
       * small GW
    - Timing Info:
       * received by all Nodes
       * if note received by node, no sense for it to received Control Messsage
       * reliability of Timing must be greater or equal that of Control Message
1.2 Reliability: MTBT
    - we need to introduce how we are going to "measure/estimate" reliability
    - short introduction of Mean Time Between Failures

2. Physical Medium and BER (Layer 1)[CP]
   
3 Forward Error Correction (upper layer)
3.1. Brief introduction (overview) of the concepts used with loads of references
3.2. FEC in WR  

4. QoS and Traffic Prioritize (CP)
   - say that Control Messages are to be broadcast pririty 7
   - say that non-Control Messages are called SP

5 Jitter, Determinism (ML)
   - estimate normal routing time, it's not enough to meet requirements
   - introduce the idea of "bypass" for broadcast priority 7, call it HP
   - say how HP improves things, make estimations regarding the number of
     hops vs jitter
   - say that SP traffic can be also deterministec if used with brains,
estimate GW for SP

6. Redundancy
   - define redundancy
   - say that we measure it's effectiveness with relibility
   - introduce terms:
     * clock path
     * data path

6.1 Clock Path Redundancy
6.1.1 Layer 1 (SynchE)
  - explain how it works
  - explain restrictions
6.1.2 Layer 2 (WRPTP)
  - explain how it works
6.1.3 Clock Path Topologies
  - show possible topologies
6.2 Data Path Redundancy
6.2.1 Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)
  - explain how it works
  - say how it helps
6.2.2 RSTP in WR
6.2.2.1 SP Traffic
  - hardware link down detection
  - use ide from CISCO (UplinkFast) - I will investigate if it's possible
6.2.2.1 HP Traffic
  - port change in HW
  - how we want to avoid loosing HP Packages (wait for gap between burst)
6.2.3 Possible Topologies for WR RSTP
  - pros/cons
  - costs
  - we need to consider many levels of redundancy (reliability), so analysing
different topologies is perfect
  - need to show topology without any redundancy and that it works
  - 
6.3 Data and Clock Path redundancy strategy
  - so we now consider Data and Clock Paths togother
  - the ultimate strategy for the Redundancy in WR

7 Network Dimentions
  - network dimention vs Granuality Window (some nice formula)
  - Network Dimention vs topology (some nice pic)

8 Diagnostic with White Rabbit Switch
  - management IP
    * option to have HP traffic or not to have
    * option to have FEC in SP or not
    * etc
  - giving seq_numbers to HP Packages to check number of lost ones
  - giving seq_numbers to Control Messages to check number of lost ones
  - measuring latency in switches ???? posibble, maybe optional (forward
messages to control port, have dummy packates to measure latency...)
   
x Flow Control
x.1 Flow control in Layer 1
x.2 Flow control in Layer 2


x = i'm not sure which chapter, but it's quite self contained, so can be put
somewher later Ou would say between 5 and 6
