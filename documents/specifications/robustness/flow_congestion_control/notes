DATA NETWORK CONGESTION
***********************
When packets being transmitted through a network approach the packet-handling capacity of the network

Network nodes are overloaded –> queues start filling up

Arrival Rate to the Switch = a 
Departure Rate to the Switch = b

Stability Condition a/b = p < 1

CONGESTION CONTROL TECHNIQUES
******************************

Backpressure
	– Request from destination to source to reduce rate
	– Propagates hop-by-hop backward along path
	– Suitable for virtual circuits

Choke Packet 
	- Could be good for Switching network
	- A host receiving a choke packet should reduce the traffic to the
	  specified destination. A variation (Hop-by-Hop Choke Packets) operate similarly but take
	  effect at each hop while choke packets travel back to the source.	

Implicit congestion signaling -> TCP

Explicit congestion signaling
	– Network responsibility to alert end systems of growing congestion
	– Direction
		• Backward: network notifies the source
		• Forward: network notifies the destination
	– Approaches
		• Binary: on/off approach
		• Credit-based: how much data can be sent
		• Rate-based: how fast data can be transmitted


Fairness
	Congestion effects should be distributed equally to traffic flows. Last-in-first-discarded may not be fair

Quality of Service

	Differentiation based on application requirements
		• Voice, video: delay sensitive, loss insensitive
		• File transfer, mail: delay insensitive, loss sensitive
		• Interactive computing: delay and loss sensitive

Reservation scheme
	To provide guaranteed services
		• Traffic policing: excess traffic discarded or handled on besteffort basis


CONCLUSION
**********
Chocke or Explicit by now are the most interesting.

Implementation:
In nodes, where? not WR Core, then in the general purpose CPU in SW

Alternative to this options to the Congestion control would be Switch Scheduling... it makes the switch way more difficult.

IDEAS
*****
We should combine for the highest priority and the rest different strategies...
E.g. HP blocking port if someone is (except the data master) sending them....

FLOW CONTROL
************
Mistake the Flow control in Ethernet, is in Layer 2---

Ethernet FLow Control....
is a mechanism for temporarily stopping the transmission of data on an Ethernet computer network. End-to-End, the switches involved.

Article, it doesn't applies to us but:
http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/index2.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=30212&pop=1&page=0&Itemid=54

Alternatives 
************

Standard 
Priority-based Flow Control, as defined by the standard IEEE 802.1Qbb provides a link level flow control mechanism that can be controlled independently for each Class of Service (CoS), as defined by IEEE 802.1p. The goal of this mechanism is to ensure zero loss under congestion in Data Center Bridging (DCB) networks.

Flow Control Techniques 

• Stop-and-wait flow control
• Sliding-window protocol 

 I don't like them for WR Network.....

CONCLUSION

Study of the Priority Based Flow Control, see what the status.

Think about policy for White Rabbit Network. Defined by the user, set it from SNMP and supervised by the Network analyzer....
