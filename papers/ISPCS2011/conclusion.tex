\section{Conclusions}

White Rabbit is an open hardware \modified{\cite{biblio:ohl}} and open software project pushing the
frontiers of technology but also introducing new trends in
cooperation between public institutions and companies.

The WRN is purposely based on well-established
standards to ensure its long lifetime, wide support and commercial
feasibility. 
By blending existing technologies, hardware-supporting and extending
them, \modified{still} %Erik's remarks
staying compatible, exceptional results are achieved. This
includes sub-ns accuracy of \modified{high precision and robust} synchronization, which 
proved to be the
most accurate known PTP implementation (ISPCS, September 2010, USA) and frequency
transfer performance of below 2ps integrated jitter using a FPGA-based
PLL design.

The WRPTP extension allows not only for increased accuracy,
but also offers much lower PTP-message traffic and higher reliability
by supporting network redundancy without any loss of performance, 
\modified{thus offering robust synchronization}.

Compatibility with existing standards enables hybrid networks, where
time- and data-critical end nodes are connected directly to a White
Rabbit Network, while less critical devices use standard switches to
connect to it.
