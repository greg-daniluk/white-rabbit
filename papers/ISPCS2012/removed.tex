The synchronization between UTC time base at GPS receiver and measurement point is performed 
using two independent systems (running in parallel):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item General Machine Timing at CERN and detectors' timing system (e.g OPERA's) at LNGS.
  \item White Rabbit at CERN and LNGS.
\end{enumerate}
\figurename~\ref{fig:operaTiming} depicts synchronization of the OPERA \cite{biblio:TOF} 
detector and delays introduced by each of its elements. Additionally, the new White Rabbit 
installation is presented in the figure to indicate its role in the synchronization. 

The former systems (1) have been in operation for CNGS time transfer since 2010. 
Their accuracy is achieved by hand-evaluating delays introduced by each element of the timing 
systems at CERN and LNGS using methods described in 
\cite{biblio:BECOHT_CNGS} and \cite{biblio:TOF}.
The latter system, White Rabbit, has been installed at CERN and LNGS very recently. 
It enables to transfer the common UTC time base from the GPS 
receiver to the measurement points automatically compensating for the delays and their variation. 
Its installation setup is described in the next section.
