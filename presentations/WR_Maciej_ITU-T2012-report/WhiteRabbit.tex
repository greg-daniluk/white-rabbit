\begin{frame}{WR standardization Feedback}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Many different suggestions:
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Find common base between G.827x and WRPTP, try aligning
	  \item Do ITU-T WRPTP profile, very similar to telecom profile
	  \item Standardize WRPTP profile directly within IEEE
	  \item Find scientific equivalence of ITU-T/IEEE to standardize
	\end{itemize}    
    \item CERN ITU-T member ?
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Good publicity for ITU and CERN
	  \item Probably within some scientific cooperation
	  \item Benefits for both sides (experience, PR)
	\end{itemize}    
    \item Whatever standardization path - strong suggestion to cooperate with Q13/15
    \item Next ISPCS meeting important - decision regarding PTPv3
