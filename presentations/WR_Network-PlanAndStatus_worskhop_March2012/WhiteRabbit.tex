\begin{frame}{FEC: Linear Code and 8b/10b I}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The FEC scheme is \textbf{Linear Code} for the Binary Erasure
    Channel and a \textbf{Block Code} for the Packet Erasure Channel. 
    \item The numbers told us that we need to repair just a bit... Hamming was the option.
    \item Gigabit Ethernet uses \textbf{8b/10b} in the physical layer. 
    \item One bit error in a 10 bits encoded code word may result in a multi-bit
    error $>2$ $\rightarrow$
    \textbf{Hamming is not enough!}.
    \item The best Linear Code able to recover 4 bit error and detect up to 8 is
    the \textbf{Golay Code Family}.
  \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Golay is a (24,12,8) code, rate of $50\%$ 
        \item \textbf{Fixed encoding time} and \textbf{upper bound} for the
        \textbf{decoding}
        \item Hardware implementation of a variant of the Golay Code:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Encoding in one clock
                \item Decoding, best case 2 clocks, worst case 6 clocks working
                at 125 Mhz 
            \end{itemize}
        \item Next steps: 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item hook it to the Starter Kit and plus the Block Code,
                and then we have a FEC.
                \item Customization of the code for our case

\begin{frame}{Link Aggregation Control Protocol plus FEC I}

\begin{itemize}
    \item LACP provides the means to show two networks interface as a single  interfacea
    \item When the network interfaces are not in the same physical switch a  multipath is created for a frame
    \item Normally the multipath is used for balancing the traffic
    \item On the other hand, the FEC destributes the control information in several frames
    \item What if we send $X\%$ of this frames in one path and $Y\%$ in the alternative path
    \item We could overcome with sucseed single points of failure in the network: switch breakdown and damaged fiber optic or ports.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Link Aggregation Control Protocol plus FEC III}

\begin{itemize}
    \item It fullfils the GSI and CERN 
    \item Doesn't jepardize the deterministic delivery of information, 
\end{itemize}

There is a smoothly continuation of the service there is not rush we have the \textbf{redundancy beforhand.}

Pros of LAC-FEC

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is not idle resources: port, fiber optic etc...
    \item At least duplication of the bandwidth upstream 
    \item The proposed scheme doesn't break the standard
    \item The IEEE standard is alive, present in almost all comercial switches (cisco, hp...)
