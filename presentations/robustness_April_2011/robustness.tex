\subsection{What is a robust White Rabbit Network}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Definition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\centering

A White Rabbit Network (WRN) is considered robust only if all the WR nodes
connected to the network always receive data on time and are always
synchronized with the required accuracy. The amount of lost frames in a given 
period of time never exceeds the upper bound.

  \frametitle{Naming Conventions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\centering

\begin{itemize}
  \item Granularity Window (GW).
  \item Types of the information distributed over WRN:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Control Data - Control Messages (CM),
    \item Clock        - timing information (PTP+SyncE),
    \item Standard Data - all the other Ethernet traffic,
  \end{itemize}
  \item Class of Service and Quality of Service (CoS and QoS),
  \item High Priority traffic (HP),
  \item Standard Priority traffic (SP).
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{DISCUSSION:} \\
Most of the names introduced here are not in line with standard naming
conventions and need to be changed, ideas appreciated.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Clock Stability preservation during switch-over (change of clock

  \item Two dependencies:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Syntonization -- SyncE - PLLs by Tomek are designed to accommodate
          many clock sources, theoretically stability during switch-over is not
          an issue.
    \item Synchronization -- WRPTP - Each port speaks independently WRPTP
          unaware which one is active, no change WRPTP-wise during switch over.
  \end{itemize}
 \item Tests are needed to prove the theory in practice.
 \item Logical topology of Clock distribution is aligned with logical topology
       of Data, active and backup ports (clock/data sources) assigned
       using Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol.
