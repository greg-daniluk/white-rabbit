Robustness definition - WTF
  *determinism
  *synchronization

Robustness - division/what we deal with
  * Determinism
  * Clock resilience
  * Data resilience
  * Diangostic and Monitoring- prevention

Requirements (pain in the ass)
  * we don't know (Control Data size, length Data Master to Data Slave)
  * need to change some - maybe some more realistic
  * we need this for precise analysis
  * discussion: we need more specific req, change of 1 CM lost per year, what
    is reasonable?

Determinism 
 * 100us very tight 
 * we need bypass, 
 * Discuss: dropping of HP on collision, sending of HP by other then DM, more
   DMs
 
Clock Resilience
 * in theory looks beutiful.... but tests needed
 * topology constraints

Data Path Resilience - 
 * topology redundancy (Rapids Spanning Tree)
 * data redundancy     (FEC)
 * Flow and Congestion control

Data Path Resilience - Topology Redundancy
 * we need to implement very fast switching  (to loose max single frame)
 * we want to use RSTP with hardware support and topology constraints
 * Layers limited
 * to achieve 1 lost CM per year, initial estimations say we need at least
   redundancy, with number of ouputs from Data Master
 * all this efforts bring limited results if we have single connection with the
   node !!!

Data Path Resilience - data redundancy
 * for the time being RS + hamming
 * discuss: we need to know size in advance, how?
 * discuss: burst of CM info vs no-standard-size ethernet frame for CM > 1500
   Bytes

Data Path Resilience - Flow and Congestion Control 
 * blocking of HP traffic from other ports

Monitoring
 * we want to detect any  lost frame of CM
 * info about lost CM
 * synch quality -> we can only measure variation if it comes to quality

DISCUSSION (OHMG):
- Names: High Priority vs. Standard Priority, Granuality Window, Clock Master
         Control Message, Control Data/Clock Data/Standard Data, 
- requrements: 1 CM lost per year
- hp collisions and who can send them
